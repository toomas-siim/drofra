# Firefly
Coded in python, the firefly drone isn't as much of a drone, more of a framework for drones.
You have a drone.ini file in the root folder, where you can configure it according to the technical specs you have set.

Supports a number of sensors and systems like GPS, Motors, Servos, Gyro, Compass, Camera, Radio Comms etc...
